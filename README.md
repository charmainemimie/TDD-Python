In Python tests are functions with "test" at the beginning of the function name. 
They use the standard python "assert" statement.
Similar tests can be grouped together by including them in the same module or class.
Pytest will automatically discover tests based on a standard naming convention

Classes should have "Test" at the beginning of the class name and not have the "__init__" method.
